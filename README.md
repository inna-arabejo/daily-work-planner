# Daily Work Planner

## Description
Create a planner that allows you to save events for each hour of the day on a calendar. This planner enables an employee with a busy schedule to add important events so that they can manage their time effectively. You will be utilizing the Moment.js library to work with date and time. 

## Task 
To schedule events on a daily planner, the following requirements are met when:
- The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
- There are timeblocks for each hour displayed.
- Each timeblock is color coded to indicate past, present, and future time.
- An event can be entered when the timeblock is clicked.
- The event entered is then saved in local storage.
- The data for the event entered is still displayed when there is a page refresh.
